# Smok: Gra w programowanie.

Smok (The Dragon) is a small computer-based riddle game aimed at children. By
putting objects on the board we are guiding the Dragon towards the cave.

From mathematical standpoint, the Dragon is a Turing machine with counters
operating on a two-dimensional tape.

The original game was designed and implemented in Flash by Bartosz Dolecki for
[Wroc≈Çawski Portal Informatyczy](https://informatyka.wroc.pl/) (a local
educational website). This repository contains a quick implementation of some
basic principles of that game in Vue. Meanwhile a full reimplementation is being worked on with use of React.
